# Guess the Movie Game

Guess the Movie is a simple web-based game where players guess the name of a movie by filling in missing letters. Each letter corresponds to an image of a bomb. Correct guesses keep the bomb intact, while incorrect guesses cause the bomb to explode.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. You'll see a grid of bomb images with input fields underneath.
3. Guess the correct letter for each bomb and type it into the corresponding input field.
4. If your guess is correct, the bomb remains intact. If it's incorrect, the bomb explodes.
5. Continue guessing until you've filled in all the letters and revealed the movie name.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap for styling)
- JavaScript

## How to Customize

To customize the game:

- Modify the `correctChar` variables in the JavaScript functions to change the movie name or letters to be guessed.
- Duplicate the HTML structure for a bomb (image and input field) in the `index.html` file to add more bombs and letters to guess. Adjust IDs and image paths accordingly.
